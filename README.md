# MA5 Charger with SDS EFII and Two Batteries

This is the electrical schematic for a Marquart MA5 Charger. The MA5 will
be powered by a Lycoming O-290 engine. Fuel and spark will be provided by 
SDS EFII.

Because so much of the EFII installation is electrical, I will detail the entire 
installation in this document.

## Summary

The electrical system will have three distribution buses. 

* Main Power Distribution Bus - Supplies power to all non-essential (things that
  don't make the engine quit) items. Radio, Instrument Lights, Landing Light, Strobe Light.

## Equipment List

* One ECU - This is the computer that runs the engine. I've elected to use a single
            ECU because this is a day / VFR airplane, not flown over high density 
            areas or unforgiving terrain. Additionally, wiring dual ECU's has it's
            pitfalls and introduces potential for other problems. The ECU's are also
            considered to be extremely reliable - Far more reliable than an old-style 

* Two Coil Packs - At least that's the inital plan. Mostly because I have two spark plug 
            holes per cylinder that have to be filed with something.

* Two Fuel Pumps - Two Bosch Fuel Pumps
